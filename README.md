### Hi, I am Ahmed ðŸ‘‹

# My Background

I studied for an Economics BA. After graduation, I became a self-taught System Development in the Legal Tech Sector. Over three years of experience working on large projects, dealing with end-to-end development life cycles, strict time constraints, and managing technical and non-technical stakeholders. Started offering my services as a consultant/freelancer in 2022 and maintained my business since. Money is good, but I need more exciting projects and technology that has the potential to change the world as we know it. Plus I like the idea of fully remote work!

# Why Blockchain
  
My early fascination with fiction and exploration has found new expression in the blockchain domain. This field represents not just a technological frontier, but a personal renaissance of my childhood dreams. It's an area where innovative thinking and bold steps are not just welcomed, but essential. I am sharpening my machete, ready to hack away at the dense undergrowth, as web3 is built and defined. There will be cuts and bruises, but, it will be worth it!

# Iâ€™m currently building
  
Leveraging my skills in Solidity and front-end development, I've successfully participated in the Chainlink Constellation hackathon, securing a runner-up position. My objective for this year is to engage in at least three hackathons, marking each achievement here as a testament to my continuous growth.


# Iâ€™m currently learning

I am currently enhancing my expertise through Updraft's Foundry course, focusing on contract testing skills. Under the guidance of industry leaders like Patrick Collins, I am committed to refining my technical skill set and staying abreast of the latest industry advancements.
