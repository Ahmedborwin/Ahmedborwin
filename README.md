### Hi, I am Ahmed ðŸ‘‹

- My Background

Studied economics. Fell into System Development in the Legal Tech Sector - Self taught. Over three years of experience working on large projects, dealing with requirements prioritisation, time constraints, and managing technical and non-technical stakeholders. Started offering my services as a consultant/freelancer in 2022 and managed to maintain my limited company. Money is good, but I need more exciting projects and technology that has the potential to change the world as we know it. 

- Why Blockchain
  
I grew up reading a lot of fiction and dreamt of adventure and striking off into the unknown. At some point, I lost that. Blockchain re-ignited that fire and passion in me.
I will be part of this journey. I am sharpening my machete, ready to hack away at the dense undergrowth, as web3 is built and defined. There will be cuts and bruises, but, it will be worth it!

- Iâ€™m currently building
  
  Applying the solidity and front-end skills I have learned over the past year and building projects. My first real project was submitted to Chainlinks Constellation hackathon and that won a runner-up prize for top quality.
  I am excited to join more hackathons this year! The goal is to join at least 3 Hackathons! I will tick them off here as and when I complete them


- Iâ€™m currently learning

Slowly going through updrafts foundry course. I want to add foundry to my toolbox and improve my contract testing skills. No one better to learn from than Patrick Collins!
